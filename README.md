# starchart3d

This is a hobby project for creating a 3D starmap for Augmented Reality in the Unity Game Engine.
The GitHub repo accompanies the YouTube series.

To get the project in its state at any point in the series please refer to previous commits.

## Intended Audience

The project is intended for the **Intermediate Unity Programmer**. S

- Unity
    - Scriptable Objects
    - Procedural Meshes
    - Geometry Shaders
    - Augmented Reality
- C#
    - File IO
    - Abstract classes
    - Linq Queries
    - Arrow syntax

## Friendly Advice

This project has some specialized content and it can be stressfull when something we don't understand isn't working. It is important to *avoid* this scenario. For instance, if the point cloud geometry shader isn't working, I recomended not to 'play', 'fudge' or 'experiment' within this project until it works. Its way more fun to start a new simple project about geometry shaders *only*, learn them inside out, then come back to this project.

## Sharing, Forking and Getting help

Remember emails aren't great for answering questions because only two people can see them. YouTube comments also aren't ideal as they don't seem to show up in searches. Check out the below handy links for sharing and communication.
